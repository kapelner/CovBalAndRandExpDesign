Description: Computes experimental designs for a
    two-arm experiment with covariates by greedily optimizing a
    balance objective function via pariwise switching. This optimization 
    provides lower variance for the treatment effect estimator (and higher 
    power) while preserving a design that is close to complete randomization.
    We return all iterations of the designs for use in a permutation test.
    Additional functionality includes using branch and bound optimization 
    (via Gurobi) a la Bertsimas and Kallus, Morgan & Rubin's rerandomization, 
    Karp's method for one covariate and exhaustive enumeration to find the 
    optimal solution (only for small sample sizes).
